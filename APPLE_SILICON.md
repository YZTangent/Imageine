# Running Imageine on Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)

## Quick Answer

✅ **Imageine now fully supports Apple Silicon!**

The system automatically detects your M-series chip and uses **MPS (Metal Performance Shaders)** for GPU acceleration.

---

## What Changed

### Before (CUDA Error)
```
Error: torch not compiled with cuda enabled
```

### After (Auto-Detection)
```
Auto-detected device: MPS (Apple Silicon)
ModelManager initialized (device=mps, dtype=torch.float16)
```

---

## How It Works

1. **Auto-Detection**: Config now defaults to `device: "auto"`
2. **MPS Support**: PyTorch 2.8+ has built-in Apple Silicon support
3. **Fallback**: If MPS unavailable, falls back to CPU

### Device Priority
```
1. CUDA (if NVIDIA GPU detected)
2. MPS (if Apple Silicon detected) ← Your Mac uses this
3. CPU (if no GPU detected)
```

## Performance on Apple Silicon

### M2 Pro (Your System)
- **Unified Memory**: Shares RAM with GPU (e.g., 16GB/32GB)
- **Expected Speed**:
  - Simple pipeline: ~15-30 seconds
  - Complex pipeline: ~30-60 seconds
- **Memory**: 8-12GB for full model stack

### Tips for Better Performance

1. **Close other apps** to free GPU memory
2. **Reduce steps** for faster inference:
   ```yaml
   generation:
     default_steps: 20  # Lower = faster
   ```

3. **Monitor memory**:
   ```bash
   # Check GPU usage
   uv run python -c "import torch; print('MPS memory allocated:', torch.mps.current_allocated_memory() / 1e9, 'GB')"
   ```

---

## Verification

Test that MPS is working:

```bash
uv run python -c "
import torch
print('PyTorch version:', torch.__version__)
print('MPS available:', torch.backends.mps.is_available())
print('MPS built:', torch.backends.mps.is_built())

from src.utils.config import Config
from src.models.loader import ModelManager

config = Config('config/default.yaml')
manager = ModelManager(config)
print('Device selected:', manager.device)
"
```

Expected output:
```
PyTorch version: 2.8.0
MPS available: True
MPS built: True
Auto-detected device: MPS (Apple Silicon)
Device selected: mps
```

## Known Limitations

### MPS vs CUDA Differences

1. **Some operations not supported**: Rare edge cases may fall back to CPU
2. **Memory management**: Unified memory means less VRAM than dedicated GPU
3. **First run slower**: Model compilation happens on first inference

### Workarounds

If you encounter MPS errors:

1. **Fall back to CPU**:
   ```yaml
   # config/default.yaml
   models:
     device: "cpu"
   ```

2. **Reduce batch size**: Already optimized (batch_size=1)

3. **Report issues**: MPS support is improving with each PyTorch release

---

## Troubleshooting

### "MPS backend out of memory"

**Solution**: Close other apps or reduce inference steps:
```yaml
generation:
  default_steps: 15  # Reduce from 25
```

### "Operation not supported on MPS"

**Solution**: This is rare but some operations fall back to CPU automatically. If it fails completely, switch to CPU mode:
```yaml
models:
  device: "cpu"
```

### Slow inference

**Check**:
1. Is MPS actually being used? Run verification script above
2. Are other apps using GPU? (Final Cut, Logic, games)
3. Is thermal throttling happening? (Check Activity Monitor)

## Comparison: M2 Pro vs RTX 3090

| Metric | M2 Pro (MPS) | RTX 3090 (CUDA) |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| Memory | 16-32GB unified | 24GB dedicated |
| Simple pipeline | ~15-30s | ~5-10s |
| Complex pipeline | ~30-60s | ~10-20s |
| Power usage | ~15-30W | ~350W |
| Noise | Silent | Fan noise |

**Verdict**: M2 Pro is 2-3x slower but excellent for development and moderate use!
